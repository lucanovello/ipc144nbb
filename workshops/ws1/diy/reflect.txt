Reflection on Workshop #1: First Program - Luca Novello (gnovello)
In the process of completing this workshop, I gained valuable experience in creating and organizing a C program using Visual Studio, organizing code into reusable functions, compiling/linking programs across different platforms, and transferring files between computers.	
The first part (LAB) of the workshop involved creating a program (lab1.c) that printed a title, a line of dashes and personal data using functions. This part emphasized the use of prototypes, the importance of proper code structuring and reusability, as well as utilizing the built-in ‘printf’ function from the standard input/output (‘stdio.h’) library. Compiling and testing the program in both Visual Studio and in Matrix helped reinforce my understanding of the trade-offs of using both environments.
The second part (DIY) asked me to write a program (diy1.c) that took some code from lab1.c and added functions for receiving three marks and outputting their average. This part helped me learn how to use the ‘scanf’ function to read user inputs.  
The only issues I ran into were with cloning my repository into my Matrix account, but I think that may be an issue with either my SSH keys or my GitHub settings.  I will be looking into that further.  
Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the workshop and can’t wait to do more C programming.
